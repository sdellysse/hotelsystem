# Super Duper Hotel System

Requires Docker.

To run, the usual `git clone`, `npm install` (and wait two years), and
`npm start`.

It'll start up a mongo docker container and the server, and then build the
frontend application and start serving it. Go to http://localhost:3000 to begin
your journey into the wonderful world of "Hotel System".
